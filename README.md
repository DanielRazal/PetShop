# PetShop

Developed using **ASP.NET MVC with Sql Server**.\
**"Paint"** is a collaborative painting application with a canvas.
 Users can draw on the canvas and, thanks to a web socket feature, see the real-time contributions of others.

Customers access animal details and share reviews. Meanwhile, admins wield streamlined control: add, delete, and edit animals.


## Running the Project

1. Open the **PetShop** project in Visual Studio.
